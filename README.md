# Na-ve-Bayes-vs-Random-Forest
CM2604 - Machine Learning

You are expected to perform a simple classification problem - that of Predicting whether income exceeds
$50K/yr based on census data. The dataset (‘Census Income’) has been taken from the UCI Machine
Learning repository (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/2/adult). This must be achieved using two machine
learning models based on Naïve Bayes and Random Forest Classification.
The meta information, class distribution, attributes, attribute statistics, etc. of the corpus can be found in
the provided link. Optimal strategies should be followed for preparing the dataset for the proposed
models. Respective libraries, frameworks, tools, etc. must be used for model implementation purposes. The
implemented models should be compared based on the optimal evaluation metrics. Experimental results
should be showcased for both model experimental settings.
