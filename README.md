# Income Prediction Using Machine Learning 📊✨

This project aims to predict a person’s income based on demographic and employment-related features, leveraging two machine learning models: **Random Forest Classification** and **Naive Bayes**. The project includes comprehensive data preprocessing, visualization, and model evaluation techniques to achieve reliable predictions.

## 🚀 Project Overview

This project involves:
- Preprocessing census data (handling missing values, duplicates, and data imbalance).
- Exploring data through visualizations (histograms, boxplots, and correlation matrices).
- Training and evaluating machine learning models for income prediction.

## 🛠️ Features

- **Data Preprocessing**:
  - Replaced missing values using forward filling.
  - Removed duplicate entries.
  - Addressed class imbalance using SMOTE.
  - Applied label encoding to convert categorical data to numerical values.

- **Exploratory Data Analysis**:
  - Plotted histograms and boxplots for numerical attributes.
  - Generated a correlation matrix to analyze feature relationships.

- **Machine Learning Models**:
  - Random Forest Classification
  - Naive Bayes Classification

- **Performance Evaluation**:
  - Accuracy and performance comparison between models.
